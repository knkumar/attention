Instructions for the test

Please read the instructions carefully. You can scroll down using the
arrow keys or space. Once you have read the instructions hit the return
(Enter) key to begin the experiment. To move to the next trial hit the "Space" key.

You will be shown a display with 12 objects around a focal
point. There is a specific object marked as a target from among these
objects. The target is defined as %s, in this case. The scoring metric
is how fast you can idenitfy the specific marked object.

The task is to find the orientation of the gabor patch, which is
either horizontal or vertical. The gabor patch is a simple image with
squiggly lines which are either vertical or horizontal in this
case. If you do not understand this, please talk to the experimenter
for guidance. The task is meant to be really simple and should be easy
to percieve.

Once you have identified the target you need to hit "h" for horizontal
or "v" for vertical on the keyboard to mark the orientation of the
gabor patch. You will given feedback on whether you got it right or
wrong. To move to the next trial hit the "Space" key.

The experiment will run for half an hour. The scores will be compiled
and returned to you at a later point. Best of Luck!
